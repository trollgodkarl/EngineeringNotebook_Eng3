## Template
Your readme should start off with a header title, like this
~~~
# Basic Onshape Cad
~~~
Then use a table of contents.  The name in the Parentheses must exactly match the name in the subheader, like this

## Exemplars

[This student did an awesome job with formatted snippets of his code, and really clear and well sized imaged](https://github.com/lmiller87/CircuitPython).  I didn't like the reflections or descriptions as much, too brief.

[His first few reflections were AMAZING.](https://github.com/vwellmo57/CircuitPython/blob/master/README.md) but the second half tapered off.  Just look at the first couple reflections.

## UsefulGitStuff

 For future use.

My former Engineering 3 Kiddos wanted you to have this webpage, they found this site was crucial in helping them figure out how to switch their brains from Arduino to Circuit Python. So bookmark this site!
